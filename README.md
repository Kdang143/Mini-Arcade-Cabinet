# Mini-Arcade-Cabinet

Created a mini arcade cabinet with a few simple electronic parts and 3D printed parts. The game that can be currently played on the arcade cabinet is Breakout where you break as many blocks as you can to obtain the highest score. The project idea was influenced by the Arduboy community.
